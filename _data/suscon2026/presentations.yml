    presentation_title: "Skin, Psyche, and the Sacred Pull"
    presentation_description: >
      Skin, Psyche, and the Sacred Pull is a deep dive into the psychological, somatic, and neurobiological layers of hook suspension, exploring how vulnerability, community, and the nervous system come together to create profound transformation. Attendees will learn how psychological concepts appear in suspension spaces, why co-regulation is essential for safety and connection, and how the brain’s own mechanisms and shape the emotional and physical experience of going up. This class blends science with soul and offers a rich, grounded framework for understanding how suspension changes us from the inside out.

      Julia Church comes from a colorful background in biochemistry and spent several years working in environmental, pharmaceutical, and genetic research industries. She ultimately ended up in natural medicine and quality control after realizing she was unwilling to sell her soul to a pharmaceutical company. Her first experience with suspension was facilitated by Lisa in 2015, prior to a marathon of surgeries that took six years to complete. A decade later, she has returned to suspension in search of community, exploration, and communion with the divine self. Above all else, she is passionate about the things that science cannot explain.
