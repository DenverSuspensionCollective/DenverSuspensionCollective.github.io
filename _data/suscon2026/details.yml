  near the venue.
food: >
  Snacks and light refreshments (all vegetarian, mostly vegan) will be available daily during the event.
  There are a few restaurants within walking distance, as well as many food delivery options available.
hooks:
  - We will provide hooks and shackles for most suspensions. Please note that the hooks
    provided have been used before and have been processed and sterilized in accordance
    with the City and County of Denver Rules and Regulations for Body Art Establishments.
  - Some new hooks will be available for purchase at the event but in order to use them there,
    sterilization must be arranged beforehand. If you have any concerns about previously used
    hooks or want to arrange to purchase hooks for your suspension at the event, please contact us.
  - If you bring your own hooks to use at the event,
    please ensure they are in sterile packages which have not been compromised.
  - Most suspensions will be accommodated at the event, but if you think your suspension may require special attention,
    involve multiple practitioners, use an unusually high number of hooks, or have additional risks for any reason,
    please contact us to discuss what's possible.
covid:
  - For everyone's wellbeing during the 2026 Denver Suscon, we encourage attendees to take precautions while traveling,
    including wearing masks, maintaining distance from others when possible, and using hand sanitizer regularly.
    Upon arrival, anyone experiencing COVID symptoms should notify the organizer or volunteers,
    who will provide rapid tests as needed.
  - While we aim to create a comfortable environment for all, participants displaying COVID symptoms may
    be asked to wear a mask during the event. Hand sanitizer will be widely available throughout the event,
    but participants are also encouraged to bring hand sanitizer for personal use outside the event.
