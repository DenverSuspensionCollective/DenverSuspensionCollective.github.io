    with the City and County of Denver Rules and Regulations for Body Art Establishments.
  - Some new hooks will be available for purchase at the event but in order to use them there,
    sterilization must be arranged beforehand. If you have any concerns about previously used
    hooks or want to arrange to purchase hooks for your suspension at the event, please contact us.
  - If you bring your own hooks to use at the event,
    please ensure they are in sterile packages which have not been compromised.
covid:
  - For everyone's wellbeing during our retreat, we encourage attendees to take precautions while traveling,
    including wearing masks, maintaining distance from others when possible, and using hand sanitizer regularly.
    Upon arrival, anyone experiencing COVID symptoms should notify the organizer or volunteers,
    who will provide rapid tests as needed.
  - While we aim to create a comfortable environment for all, participants displaying COVID symptoms may
    be asked to wear a mask during the event. Hand sanitizer will be widely available throughout the event,
    but participants are also encouraged to bring hand sanitizer for personal use outside the event.
