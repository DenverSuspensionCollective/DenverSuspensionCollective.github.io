*Denver Suspension Collective Code of Conduct.*

{% include heading_block.html title="Overview" %}

Denver Suspension Collective (DSC) is committed to preventing violence and making our events a safe and inclusive place to volunteer, learn, and network. We do not tolerate behavior that is violent, threatening, intimidating, harassing, bullying, or coercive towards anyone.

Bullying, harassment and/or discrimination in the workplace is unlawful in accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA).

With this Code of Conduct (COC) we are encouraging everyone to behave responsibly and to be a credit to our community. This entails acting in good faith and showing respect for every person that they work alongside.

Volunteers and suspendees are bound by federal and state workplace safety regulations. This means that everyone is responsible for ensuring that work spaces are free from sexual harassment, discrimination or bullying.

We do not permit any act of harassment, including harassment or discrimination that is based, in fact or perception, on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, or gender identification, as well as any other legally protected characteristics.

This COC is a living document and, as such, is subject to ongoing review. DSC welcomes suggestions for amendments - and acknowledges the need for continual examination of our community's working practices and standards.

We believe that this Code is an opportunity for everyone to work towards a more collaborative, communicative and empowering space. This means that everyone feels confident that they will not be exposed to emotional, cultural or physical harm and because the ways in which we work are broad -- we must be extra vigilant about ensuring there is no space for problematic behavior to exist.

{% include heading_block.html title="Purpose" %}

This COC is intended to create and maintain a safe environment for everyone, and to encourage and enable anyone to raise legitimate concerns within the group prior to seeking resolution outside the organization. Consent is everything - we have a zero-tolerance policy for any breaches of consent.

{% include heading_block.html title="Scope" %}

This COC applies to all of our events. Any violation of this policy could result in disciplinary action, including expulsion from current events, suspension from future events, and/or suspension of any volunteer position. In addition to potential negative consequences for individuals, discrimination may result in violations of laws which may result in civil or criminal litigation against the individuals who engaged in discriminatory practices.

{% include heading_block.html title="When Does This Code Apply?" %}

This code applies to all volunteers, suspendees and enthusiasts and it applies in all aspects of a suspension event, wherever that may take place.

All those involved have a responsibility for ensuring they treat their fellow attendees and contacts in an event space with dignity and respect, and to be aware of the potential impact their behavior has on others. With this code, DSC encourages all performers to call out inappropriate behavior as soon as it arises. (See raising a complaint section below.)

The nature of suspension involves an intense interaction with many individuals. This process can expose volunteers and suspendees to vulnerable situations.

{% include heading_block.html title="General Conduct" %}

Harassment of any kind is about the abuse of power. DSC encourages practitioners to take responsibility for the power they have in the workplace, and not use it abusively over others who may be more vulnerable than themselves.

Some general guidelines are:

- Volunteers / attendees should not be subject to negative commentary and/or stereotypes on: sexuality, gender identity, age, physical attributes or abilities, race or ethnicity, class, size, attractiveness, or personality characteristics, clothing or sexiness.

- Avoid being dismissive and rude.

- Making assumptions about gender, sexuality, race, class or religion of volunteers / attendees is disrespectful.

- Strive to use people's proper names, pronunciation and pronouns.

- Shaming or public outbursts are threatening and have absolutely no place in a workplace environment.

- We are literally getting under your skin; this intimacy is a lot more comfortable for both parties if personal hygiene is looked after.

- Be polite to your fellow volunteers / attendees.

- Photographs are to only be taken with the prior consent of the person being photographed. Please notify volunteers if you do not wish your photo to be taken.

- At events, pay attention to your surroundings and what is going on around you.

- Help us to maintain a tidy and clean venue.

- Do not hesitate to inform the volunteers if you have suggestions or notice any violations of these rules.

- There are sharp objects and contaminated equipment around. Pay attention to what might be near you. If you are not a volunteer, or, you are a volunteer but do not have a specific role, do not touch anything unless you are directed to do so. If in doubt, ask someone. Don't touch anything with blood on it, not even your own blood.

{% include heading_block.html title="Harassment" %}

Harassment on the grounds of gender identity, marital status, family status, race, age, religion, size, sexual orientation or disability is defined as any unwanted conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the person.

Unwanted conduct may consist of acts, requests, spoken words, gestures or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material.

Examples of harassment might include:

- Verbal harassment -- jokes, comments, ridicule or songs

- Written harassment -- texts, messages, social media posts, emails, letters and notices

- Physical harassment -- unnecessary touching, non-consensual touching or any form of assault

{% include heading_block.html title="Sexual Harassment" %}

Sexual harassment is any form of non-consensual verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the person.

This conduct is not limited by the gender(s) of the complainant and the alleged perpetrator(s). The non-consensual conduct may consist of acts, requests, spoken words, gestures, physical contact or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material.

Examples of sexual harassment include:

- Unwelcome sexual gestures

- Unwanted displays of sexually suggestive objects including images, text messages or emails

- Unwelcome sexual comments and jokes

- Unwelcome physical contact such as pinching and groping. Or more benign touching that is unnecessary or it has been communicated is unwanted.

- Physical force, or threat of force, for sexual objective

- Threat of disadvantage for rejection of advances

- Promise of advantage for sexual concessions

{% include heading_block.html title="Bullying" %}

Bullying is repeated inappropriate behavior, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical, online or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another, or others, at events and/or in the course of volunteering which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity at events.

Bullying is deliberate and intentional. It is usually not a one-off incident, but is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated over time. Many types of conduct and actions can constitute bullying with some being less obvious than others. Bullying can consist of persistent offensive, abusive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behavior carried out by any individual or group against another person, either directly or indirectly, which makes the recipient feel upset, threatened, humiliated or vulnerable.

By way of example only, a pattern of any of the following (non-exhaustive) types of conduct amount to bullying:

- Sharing content about co-workers online that is derogatory and/or shaming

- Personal insults and name calling

- Persistent unjustified criticism and/or sarcasm

- Public or private humiliation

- Shouting at colleagues in public and/or private

- Instantaneous rage, often over trivial issues or genuine mistakes

- Unfair or unrealistic delegation of duties and responsibilities

- Aggression

- Making offensive comments about other volunteers

- Not giving credit for work contributions and ideas

- Intimidation and threats in general

- Physical & emotional abuse

- Spying or stalking

- Pressuring someone to drop a complaint

Bullying can have a physiological, psychological and behavioral impact on an individual. Victims can lose their self-esteem and self-confidence and are at increased risk of suffering stress-related conditions that can trigger further trauma.

Apart from the direct impact on a victim's health, long-term exposure to bullying may also have consequences for the victim's opportunities, through absenteeism from events in order to avoid contact with the bully.

{% include heading_block.html title="Steps To Take Where Harassment Has Occurred" %}

Anyone who is asked to stop any harassing behavior should comply immediately. If you are being harassed, or witness inappropriate behavior, speak out about it. Seek support for yourself or offer support to the person harmed. If you feel comfortable to do so, call out the inappropriate behavior immediately. You might find it helpful to use this type of language: "That is not appropriate -- it makes me feel uncomfortable". Or you can raise it at a later time.

The "bystander effect" is all too common - a culture of silence perpetuates harm. If the behavior is not rectified immediately, or if you do not feel comfortable addressing the perpetrator directly, feel free to fill in an incident report form, which can be obtained from event coordinators.

{% include heading_block.html title="Making a Complaint of Sexual Harassment" %}

Every team / event should have policies to deal with sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying. If you experience or witness sexual harassment in any event setting you have a right to speak up and, if appropriate, to make a formal complaint.

If you decide to make a complaint then you can expect the following to happen:

- The complaint should be taken seriously by the Incident Resolution Team (IRT)

- Your complaint should be documented regardless of whether or not a formal investigation is conducted.

- There is an obligation on the IRT to discuss with you the steps to be taken to ensure your safety.

- Your complaint should be addressed in a fair, timely, and confidential manner. If a serious crime has occurred there is an obligation to report it to the police.

- You should be given information by the IRT about what complaint procedures are available to you. These may be formal or informal processes.

- The IRT should follow the complaints procedure you elect, and you should be allowed to have a support person with you throughout the process.

- Only you, and those people who need to know in order for the complaint to be properly and fairly investigated, should be provided information about your complaint.

- In the case of a formal complaint, the person you have made the complaint against should be notified and given an opportunity to respond.

- If a person is found to have sexually harassed you there should be clear consequences for their actions.

- By law you are protected from being adversely affected as a result of making a complaint of sexual harassment.
